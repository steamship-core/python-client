Steamship
=========

Welcome to Steamship!

The best way to get started is by trying out a package.
First, you'll need to install our CLI. In your terminal, run the following command (you'll need `NPM`_):

.. code:: bash

   npm install -g @steamship/cli

Once installed, try out using a Steamship :ref:`package<Packages>` with:

.. code:: bash

   ship try

Or develop your own :ref:`package<Packages>` or :ref:`plugin<Plugins>` with:

.. code:: bash

   ship create
