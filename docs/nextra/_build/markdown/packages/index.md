# Packages

[Steamship Packages](https://www.steamship.com/packages) are cloud-hosted software libraries you can use in any programming environment.

Think of them as regular software libraries with an upgrade:

- **Packages bundle a full-lifecycle AI stack.**
  Everything necessary to go from demo to production in minutes: code, models, data, and infrastructure.
- **Packages auto-manage their own infrastructure.**
  If a package depends on an embedding index or a fine-tuned model, you donâ€™t have to care.
- **Packages are stateful.**
  You can create as many instances as you want: one per user, one per chat room, one per document folder. They remember their context.

That gives you the ability to use the full breadth of modern AI with a single `import` statement.

Import and use full-lifecycle language-AI packages in your Python, Javascript, and HTTP projects.

Build and deploy your own packages with our low-code framework. Works with your favorite AI services.
