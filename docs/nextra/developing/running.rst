Running on Localhost
--------------------

To run your project on localhost type:

.. code-block:: bash

   ship run local

<Callout emoji=\"⚠️\">
An ngrok account is required to run this command.
</Callout>

This will start a local instance with a number of ways to interact with it:

- A Console REPL, which will start immediately in the console.
- An HTTP endpoint, which will be printed to the console
- A Web endpoint, which will be printed to the console

The output will look like this:

.. code-block:: bash

   Running your project..

Localhost caveats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Running on localhost currently does not yet support asynchronous tasks.
In practice, this most often comes up with our ``DocumentIndexerPipelineMixin``, which enables loading in PDFs, YouTube videos, and other large documents for vector storage and retrieval.
