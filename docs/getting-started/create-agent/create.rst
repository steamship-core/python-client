Create Your First Agent
=======================

Now that you have a Steamship account, you are ready to get started with the platform. We think the best introduction
to using the platform is to create an agent, run it locally, and the deploy it to Steamship (and maybe even to share it
with others). We have the perfect starter project for this, ready to go.

To create your first agent, you'll need a GitHub account and a web browser.

Our starter project is: https://github.com/steamship-core/multimodal-agent-starter

To make your own agent using this repo, you may choose from the following options:

1. Clone the repository locally
1. Open the repository in a Github codespace.

A third option of forking (or copying) the repository and then choosing one of the above two options exists as well.

Clone the repository locally
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This option is useful for those that want low-latency development environments and are comfortable managing their
own package installs.

For this option, you'll need to have the following installed on your dev machine:

1. Python 3.8
1. git
1. A code editing environment of your choice


Open the repository in a GitHub Codespace
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This option is the simplest option, if you don't mind a little latency. Your copy of the starter project will live
entirely on GitHub's servers, requiring no local modifications or compute environment.

To choose this option, click the green ``Use This Template`` on the GitHub project page and use the drop-down list to
select the ``Open in a codespace``. After a few moments, Github will provide you with a working copy of the starter
project, running in your browser.
