Blockifiers
-----------

Blockifier Plugins convert data into Steamship’s native format.

-  A Blockifier’s input is raw bytes that may contain a PDF, image,
   audio, HTML, CSV, API response, or so on.
-  A Blockifier’s output is an object in Steamship’s native Block
   format.

You can easily fork, customize, and `deploy <docs/DEPLOYING.md>`__ the
Blockifier Plugin in this project. Once you’ve deployed it, you can
`import and use it <docs/USING.md>`__ across your Workspaces and
Packages.
