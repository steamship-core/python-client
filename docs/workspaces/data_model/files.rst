Files
~~~~~

Files are the top-level object for any piece of data in a workspace.

A file is always uploaded as raw data and then processed by a Blockifier plugin to convert it into Steamship Block Format.
This means a Steamship File has a broader definition than "file on your desktop." It could be a PDF file, a YouTube video, or the JSON representation of an AirTable table or a Notion document.
