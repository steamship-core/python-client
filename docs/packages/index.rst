Packages
========

Steamship Packages are cloud-hosted software libraries you can import into any programming environment.

Think of them as regular software libraries with an upgrade:

- **They bundle a full-lifecycle Language AI stack.**
  Everything necessary to go from demo to production in minutes: code, models, data, and infrastructure.

- **They auto-manage their own infrastructure.**
  If the package depends on an embedding index or a fine-tuned endpoint, you don't have to care.

- **They're stateful.** Each package instance maintains cloud-hosted configuration, data, and models.
  Create or reuse as many instances as you want.
