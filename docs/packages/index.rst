Packages
========

`Steamship Packages <https://www.steamship.com/packages>`_ are cloud-hosted software libraries you can use in any programming environment.

Think of them as regular software libraries with an upgrade:

- **Packages bundle a full-lifecycle Language AI stack.**
  Everything necessary to go from demo to production in minutes: code, models, data, and infrastructure.

- **Packages auto-manage their own infrastructure.**
  If a package depends on an embedding index or a fine-tuned model, you don't have to care.

- **Packages are stateful.**
  You can create as many instances as you want: one per user, one per chat room, one per document folder. They remember their context.

That gives you the ability to use the full breadth of modern AI with a single ``import`` statement.
