.. _Python Client:

Steamship Python Client
-----------------------

To install the Steamship Python Client, run:

.. code:: bash

   pip install steamship

Then, import and use Steamship with:

.. code:: python

   from steamship import Steamship

   ai_package = Steamship.use("package_name")

Most of this documentation site is Python-centric and will assume operation via that client.
