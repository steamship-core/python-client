    """The Abstract Base Class of a Steamship Plugin.

    All Steamship Plugins implement the operation:

    - run(PluginRequest[T]) -> Response[U]

    Many plugins are effectively stateless. This run operation defines their entire capability.
    Examples of such stateless plugins are:
    - File Import Plugin
    - Export Plugin

    Other plugins have state but in a very controlled way:
    - they can be trained,
    - this trainable process produces a "model",
    - that model acts as the state on which the `run` method is conditioned

    This model is stored in the Steamship Workspace that owns the Plugin Instance, and access to it is provided by the
    hosting environment that runs the model.
    - TODO(ted) Document this process.

    These stateful plugins are called "Trainable Plugins," and they must implement the following additional methods:

    - get_training_parameters(PluginRequest[TrainingParameterInput]) -> Response[TrainingParameterOutput]
    - train(PluginRequest[TrainPluginInput]) -> Response[TrainPluginOutput]
